This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models, specifically Random Forest and XGBoost. The dataset used is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent cases comprising only 0.17% of all transactions. After preprocessing and splitting the data, both models were trained and evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to account for the imbalance. While Random Forest provided a solid baseline, XGBoost delivered better performance in identifying fraudulent cases. The project demonstrates how ensemble and boosting techniques can be effectively applied to real-world anomaly detection problems.
